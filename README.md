 # Pong Game created with Python
 
 ## Completed this capstone project by using what I learned in the Snake Game project

 Overall, it was a good project to work on. I saw similar tasks that I had to complete, but I felt like I was understanding more of what I was being thaught.
 
 The topics that I was recently learning for the past few days have been sticking and now I want to grow from it.
 
 I believe that I have one major capstone coming up - The Turtle Crossing.
 
 I'll send an update later!
 
 ## Stay Tuned!!!
